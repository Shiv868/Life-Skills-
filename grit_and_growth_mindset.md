# Grit and Growth Mindset

## Question 1. Grit

- Angela Duckworth left a consulting job and joined as a seventh grade math teacher in New York.  
- She found out that IQ does not determine the student success. This observation led her to study psychology.  
- Through research she found that IQ is not success. It was grit that defines someone's success.  
- She started studying about grit and researching about it.  
- The best idea she found is building grit in kids is something called "growth mindset" which is developed by "Carol Dweck".  


## Question 2. Introduction to Growth Mindset

- Growth mindset is an idea to make a person succeed which is developed by Carol Dweck.  
- Her work found two ways of thinking about skill and development that is fixed mindset and growth mindset.  
- There are four ingredients to growth – effort, challenges, mistakes, and feedback.  
- The people with fixed mindset actually avoid these four ingredients.  
- Coming to growth mindset people they think effort as a useful thing as an important part of learning process.  


## Question 3. Understanding Internal Locus of Control

- Claudia M Mueller conducted a study on the fifth grade students.  
- The study tells the concept of Locus of Control.  
- In the study they gave some puzzles to the students and then divided the students into two groups telling the first group did well because they worked hard while telling the second group they did well.  
- When they conducted another test on both the groups they found that the group to whom they told they did well because they were smart actually scored less marks than the other group.  
- This is called the Locus of Control.  


## Question 4. How to build a Growth Mindset

- The growth mindset has been very popularized by Carol DW who wrote a book called Mindset.  
- The growth mindset people believe in their own ability rather than blaming the circumstances like the fixed mindset people.  
- If you dont believe you can figure something out then you dont have expectancy.  
- Fixed mindset people narrow down their ability box while the growth mindset people honor the struggle they do to improve themselves.
