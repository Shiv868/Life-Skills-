# Personal Energy Quadrants & Wellness Notes

**Question 1: Calm Quadrant**

When I want to relax, I mostly listen to music and go for slow walks. Music helps to disconnect from whatever that is stressing me, and walking clears my mind.

**Question 2: Stress Quadrant**

I tend to feel stressed when I’m learning something challenging or when a deadline is very close. Unexpected issues or realizing I’ve made a mistake also trigger stress for me. In those moments, I feel pressured and tense.

**Question 3: Excitement Quadrant**

I know I’m in the excitement zone when I feel super focused and energetic. I get so involved in what I’m doing that I completely lose track of time. It feels natural and motivating rather than forced.

**Question 4: Sleep is Your Superpower – Key Points**
- Lack of sleep significantly weakens immune function
- Maintaining a regular sleep and a cool environment improves sleep quality

**Question 5: Steps to Sleep Better**
- Stop using screens and caffeine at least an hour before bedtime
- Practice light breathing exercises or gentle stretching to relax

**Question 6: Brain Changing Benefits of Exercise – Key Points**
- Exercise immediately increases feel-good brain chemicals like dopamine and serotonin
- It improves focus and mental clarity

**Question 7: Steps to Exercise More**
- Start small and stay consistent instead of aiming for perfection
- Choose activities I genuinely enjoy, like cycling, swimming, or playing a sport
