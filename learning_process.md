# Learning Principles & Study Techniques

## Question 1: What is the Feynman Technique?

Feynman Technique is a learning method which helps to understand topics deeply by explaining in simple words.  
First we study the concept and then teach it in our own language. While explaining we find the gaps and weak areas.  
Then we review again. This makes learning more clear and faster.

## Question 3: Active and Diffused Modes of Thinking

Focused mode means concentrating deeply on one topic.  
Used while solving problems or studying.

Diffused mode happens when mind is relaxed.  
It helps in creative thinking and big ideas.

Learning works best when we switch both. Example study then take break.
