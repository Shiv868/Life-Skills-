# Tiny Habits – Assignment

## Question 1: Most Interesting Story or Idea

The most interesting idea for me is:

"Plant a tiny seed in the right spot and it will grow without coaxing."

This refers to looking at our lives and identifying what we want to change, writing it down as tiny behaviors, and putting them in the right spot. The right spot is something you are already doing and allowing it to grow naturally. You don’t need motivation or willpower; you just have to plan it properly and let it emerge.

## Question 2: Making New Habits Easier Through B = MAP

Behavioral change is systematic. To make behaviors a long-term change, there are two ways: Change in environment and Tiny habits

Behavior is the aggregation of:

- M – Motivation  
- A – Ability  
- P – Prompt  

B = MAP is used to make new habits easier. Instead of trying to increase motivation, focus on improving your ability to do the task and identifying a clear action prompt.

## Question 3: Shine or Celebrate After Each Successful Completion of Habit

It is very important to “Shine” or celebrate after each successful completion of a habit, as it makes the habit more attractive to do every time.

For example, doing exercise in the morning is hard to motivate ourselves for. But if we celebrate by rewarding ourselves, like eating a chocolate after the gym, it can make it very attractive. This celebrating or shining helps us transform our action into a habit.

## Question 4: Most Interesting Story or Idea

The most interesting story to me is about a person named Dave Brailsford.

Fifteen years ago, in the early 2000s, British Cycling hired him as a coach. British Cycling had very mediocre performance in races. Dave suggested the idea of “Aggregation of Marginal Gains,” which refers to 1% improvement in everything they do. If this continues positively, it grows up to 37% in a year; otherwise, it declines to 0%.

Through this idea, British Cycling completely changed to a different level, receiving 4 gold medals in the same year.

## Question 5: Book’s Perspective About Identity

Identity is one of the major key insights in the book Atomic Habits.

The book states that "Identity change is the north star of habit change."

This means that the ultimate form of motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity. When we solve problems in terms of outcomes and results, we only solve them temporarily. But to solve problems long-term at the system level, we need to change our identity.
